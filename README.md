# CSE-571-Pacman-Reinforcement-Learning
In this project, I implemented reniforcement learning techniques including MDP's for controlling Pacman. This is done using Python 2.7.

A full description of this project can be found in [PJ4-Desp.pdf](https://github.com/forksup/CSE-571-Pacman-Reinforcement-Learning/blob/main/PJ4-Desp.pdf)

Below is an implementation of *Approximate Q-learning*. This is after the pacman agent had 50 episodes of training, and as you can see by the video the behavior is optimal although not always perfect.
