# CSE-571-Pacman-Reinforcement-Learning
In this project, I implemented reniforcement learning techniques including MDP's for controlling Pacman. This is done using Python 2.7.

A full description of this project can be found in [PJ4-Desp.pdf](https://github.com/forksup/CSE-571-Pacman-Reinforcement-Learning/blob/main/PJ4-Desp.pdf)

Below is an implementation of *Approximate Q-learning*. This is after the pacman agent had 50 episodes of training, and as you can see by the video the behavior is optimal although not always perfect. In this run, pacman did great however in others it can perform poorly. More training episodes would increase performance.

Although only a few fiels are included, the rest of the included code base can be fuond in reinforcement.zip.
